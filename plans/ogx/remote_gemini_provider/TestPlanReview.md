# Test Plan Review: remote_gemini_provider

## Rubric Scores

| Criterion | Score | Evidence | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Specificity | 2 | P0 definitions name remote::gemini specific scenarios. Risks name AIPCC wheel availability, /v1/responses limitation, JSON schema fields. | Swap test passes. |
| Grounding | 2 | All Section 4 entries trace to strategy. Zero fabrications. TBDs have rationale. | Cross-reference: all 12 entries grounded. |
| Scope Fidelity | 2 | Every strategy AC maps to a test objective. Out-of-scope matches strategy. | No orphans in either direction. |
| Actionability | 1 | Revision added sample payloads for 5 request types, TBDs with resolution paths for model IDs/operator version/MCP harness. But OpenShift version still TBD, model IDs still placeholder in payloads, embeddings endpoint path not concrete. | QE engineer could start writing test skeletons but needs 2-3 answers before executing. |
| Consistency | 2 | 6 of 6 cross-checks pass. Section 10.2 matches Section 4. Section 6.2 E2E coverage populated. | All consistency checks pass. |

**Total: 9/10**

**Verdict: Ready**

| /v1/chat/completions POST (tool calling) | "tool calling via /v1/chat/completions" (AC) | Grounded |
| Embeddings endpoint POST | "embeddings handles missing usage stats" (AC) | Grounded |
| GEMINI_API_KEY env var | "${env.GEMINI_API_KEY:+gemini-inference}" (Strategy) | Grounded |

## Section-by-Section Feedback

### Actionability (Score: 1)

The revision meaningfully improved actionability by adding sample
request/response payloads for 5 request types and documenting TBDs
with explicit resolution paths. However, three items prevent a
score of 2:

1. **OpenShift version TBD**: The test environment section does
   not specify which OpenShift version(s) the tests target. A QE
   engineer cannot provision a cluster without this.
2. **Model IDs remain placeholders**: Sample payloads use
   placeholder model identifiers (e.g., `gemini-pro`) rather than
   the actual model IDs that the remote::gemini provider will
   register. Tests that assert on model availability or
   model-specific behavior cannot be written until real IDs are
   confirmed.
3. **Embeddings endpoint path not concrete**: The embeddings test
   objective references an endpoint but does not specify the exact
   path or confirm whether it follows `/v1/embeddings` or a
   provider-specific route.

**To reach score 2**: Confirm the OpenShift version requirement
with the team, replace placeholder model IDs with the actual
values from the provider configuration, and specify the concrete
embeddings endpoint path.

### Consistency (Score: 2)

All six cross-checks pass. Section 6.2 E2E coverage matrix
is populated with mappings from P0 endpoints to E2E test cases,
closing the traceability loop.

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0.1 | 2026-06-05 | Auto-revision for Actionability gaps: (1) Added TBD with open-question rationale for Gemini model IDs in Section 3.2 — strategy explicitly lists model selection as an open question owned by PM/OGX Core Team, so no model IDs were fabricated. (2) Added sample request/response payloads for chat completions (non-streaming, streaming, per-request API key override), tool calling, and embeddings in Section 3.2 — payloads use strategy-grounded details (endpoint paths, x-ogx-provider-data header format, temperature parameter, missing usage statistics note). (3) Added TBD with rationale for MCP server harness in Sections 3.2 and 9.3 — strategy does not name a specific tool. (4) Replaced vague "Latest version" for OGX Operator in Section 3.1 with TBD and rationale — strategy does not pin a version; noted minimum capability requirement and instruction to pin once RHOAI 3.5 EA2 build manifest is available. |

### Cycle 1 Revision

- Actionability: Added sample request/response payloads, TBDs
  with resolution paths for model IDs, operator version,
  MCP harness
- All other criteria: N/A -- scored 2
